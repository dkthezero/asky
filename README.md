# agk

A terminal-based manager for distributing AI agent skills and instructions across multiple providers.

Manage vaults of reusable skills and instructions, then install them to Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Gemini, and other AI platforms — all from an interactive TUI.

## Features

- **Multi-provider support** — Install to Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Gemini, Letta, Snowflake, Firebender, AMP, and now **OpenCode**
- **Local, GitHub & ClawHub vaults** — Source skills from local directories, GitHub repositories, or the [ClawHub](https://clawhub.ai) community marketplace
- **Interactive TUI** — Browse, search, install, and update assets with keyboard navigation
- **Headless mode** — All operations available as CLI commands with `--json`, `--quiet`, and deterministic exit codes for CI/CD
- **MCP server registry** — Register, test, and enable MCP servers (Claude Code, OpenCode, and more) with a JSON-RPC handshake
- **Skill bundling** — Meta-skills with `requires:` in `SKILL.md` frontmatter auto-install dependency trees
- **Telemetry (local-only)** — Track which skills your team actually uses. Data stays on your machine; enabled by default, opt-out anytime
- **Change detection** — SHA-based hashing detects when vault assets have been updated
- **Scoped configuration** — Global settings for vaults, workspace-level settings for providers and installed assets
- **Batch operations** — Update all installed assets at once with F5

## Installation

### Homebrew (macOS & Linux)

```bash
brew tap dkthezero/agk
brew install agk
```

### Cargo (from source)

```bash
cargo install agk
```

### From releases (macOS, Linux, Windows)

Download pre-built binaries from the [Releases](https://github.com/dkthezero/agk/releases) page.

## Quick start

Launch the TUI:

```bash
agk
```

### Attach a vault

1. Press `0` to switch to the Vaults tab
2. Press `F2` to attach a new vault
3. Enter a local path (`./my-vault`) or GitHub URL (`owner/repo`)
4. Follow the prompts for branch and subfolder

### Browse & install from ClawHub

[ClawHub](https://clawhub.ai) is a community marketplace for agent skills. agk integrates with it out of the box:

1. Press `0` to switch to the Vaults tab — ClawHub appears as an inactive vault by default
2. Press `Space` on ClawHub to activate it (agk will help you install the `clawhub` CLI via Homebrew if needed)
3. Press `1` to switch to the Skills tab and start typing to search
4. agk searches your local vaults and ClawHub in parallel — remote results appear in gray with owner, downloads, and star counts
5. Press `Space` on a remote skill to install it

### Install a skill

1. Press `1` to switch to the Skills tab
2. Navigate with arrow keys, press `Space` to install
3. The skill is copied to all active providers

### Configure providers

1. Press `4` to switch to the Providers tab
2. Press `Space` to toggle providers on/off

### Register an MCP server

1. Press `2` to switch to the MCP Servers tab
2. Press `F2` to register a new MCP server
3. Fill in: Name, Command, Arguments, Transport (`stdio` or `sse`), Description
4. Confirm the security warning — agk will tell you exactly what it'll execute on your machine
5. agk auto-runs the MCP `initialize` handshake test. If it passes, the server appears in the list with `[✓]`

### Check what your team uses

1. Press `5` to switch to the Telemetry tab
2. See which skills were invoked, when, and how often — all from local log files on your machine
3. Older entries dim automatically, so you can spot stale skills at a glance

## Keybindings

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `1`–`5` | Skills, MCP Servers, Instructions, Providers, Telemetry |
| `0` | Vaults tab |
| `Up/Down` | Navigate list |
| `Space` | Install/uninstall asset, toggle provider/vault/MCP |
| `Enter` | Update selected asset |
| `F2` | Attach new vault (Vaults tab) or register MCP server (MCP tab) |
| `F4` | Refresh all vaults from source |
| `F5` | Update all installed assets |
| `Tab` | Toggle between Global and Workspace scope |
| `Type` | Search/filter by name (searches ClawHub in parallel when active) |
| `Esc` | Clear search / cancel / quit |

## Vault structure

agk expects vaults to follow this layout:

```
my-vault/
├── skills/
│   ├── my-skill/
│   │   ├── SKILL.md        # Required
│   │   └── ...              # Supporting files
│   └── another-skill/
│       └── SKILL.md
└── instructions/
    └── my-instruction/
        ├── AGENTS.md        # Required
        └── ...
```

Skills and instructions support optional YAML frontmatter for metadata:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
version: 1.0.0
---
# My Skill
...
```

Skills can declare dependencies with `requires:`:

```yaml
---
name: acme-company-pack
version: 1.0.0
requires:
  - clawhub/react-parser
  - clawhub/css-linter
requires_optional:
  - clawhub/storybook-scaffold
---
```

When someone installs `acme-company-pack`, agk recursively resolves and installs all dependencies. Circular dependencies are detected and rejected. Diamond dependencies are deduplicated.

## Configuration

agk uses two configuration scopes:

| Scope | Path | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| Global | `~/.config/agk/config.toml` | Vaults, enabled providers, telemetry settings |
| Workspace | `.agk/config.toml` | Installed assets per workspace |

MCP servers and telemetry data are stored separately:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `~/.config/agk/mcp.toml` | Registered MCP servers with activation state per provider |
| `~/.config/agk/analytics.toml` | Telemetry data (local-only, never transmitted) |

### Clean up

```bash
agk clean            # Remove workspace config
agk clean --global   # Remove global config
```

## Supported providers

| Provider | Skills | Instructions | MCP |
|----------|--------|-------------|-----|
| [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview) | `~/.claude/skills/` | `.claude/instructions/` | `.claude/mcp.json` |
| [OpenCode](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode) | `~/.config/opencode/skills/` | (Claude-compatible paths) | Flat `mcp.<name>` in `opencode.json` |
| [GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/configure-custom-instructions) | `~/.copilot/` | `.github/` | TBD |
| [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/blob/main/docs/cli/gemini-md.md) | Provider-specific | Provider-specific | — |
| [Letta](https://docs.letta.com/introduction) | Provider-specific | Provider-specific | — |
| [Snowflake](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/cortex-agents) | Provider-specific | Provider-specific | — |
| [Firebender](https://docs.firebender.com/get-started/agent) | Provider-specific | Provider-specific | — |
| [AMP](https://ampcode.com/manual) | Provider-specific | Provider-specific | — |

## Headless mode

agk works in CI/CD and automation without a terminal:

```bash
# Sync all configured assets (team onboarding)
agk sync

# Install a specific skill
agk install clawhub/web-browser

# Validate installed assets against source vaults
agk validate

# Pack a skill for distribution
agk pack my-skill --target claude-desktop

# Register an MCP server
agk mcp add --name fs --command npx \
  --args "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem /tmp" \
  --transport stdio

# Enable MCP for a provider
agk mcp enable fs --provider claude-code --scope workspace

# Check telemetry status
agk telemetry status
```

All commands support `--quiet`, `--verbose`, and `--json`.

## ClawHub integration

agk uses the [`clawhub` CLI](https://clawhub.ai) for all remote operations. When you activate the ClawHub vault, agk will:

1. Check if `clawhub` is on your `$PATH`
2. Offer to install it via Homebrew (`brew install clawhub`) if available
3. Display a manual install link if Homebrew is not available

Skills installed from ClawHub are cached in `~/.config/agk/clawhub/` and treated like any other vault source.
